<h1>Ghostentista</h1>
<h2>Theme for Ghost Blogging Platform</h2>
<h3>version 0.2</h3>
<p>Responsive, asynchronous, content centric theme for Ghost. Very loosely based on Casper and inspired by my own WordPress theme Kontentista (also not quite finished). Built using modern web technologies and with a help of LESS preprocessor. <del>Currently tested only on Webkit based browsers</del>. But will be tuned up within days. Theme is not ready for prime time, since it contains <del>lots and lots of bugs</del>, links to my social networks <del>and the code is far from tidy</del>.</p>
